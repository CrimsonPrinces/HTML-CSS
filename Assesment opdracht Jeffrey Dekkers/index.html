      <p class="paragraph-one">
        in the not too distant future, a mysterious disaster has brought
        collapse to the world as we know it. Towering skyscrapers, once symbols
        of prosperity, are now lifeless graves of humanityâ€™s past pierced by the
        Thorns of Judgment. At the center of the destruction lies a hidden
        society of Revenants called Vein. This final stronghold is where the
        remaining few fight to survive, blessed with Gifts of power in exchange
        for their memories and a thirst for blood. Give into the bloodlust fully
        and risk becoming one of the Lost, fiendish ghouls devoid of any
        remaining humanity. Wandering aimlessly in search of blood, the Lost
        will stop at nothing to satisfy their hunger. Team up and embark on a
        journey to the ends of hell to unlock your past and escape your living
        nightmare in CODE VEIN.
